                    <h1>About Me</h1>
                    <p> 
                        My name is Dajan Lyttle and I am an electrical engineer based in Seattle, WA.
                        I currently work as an Assistant Consultant Electrical Engineer at WSP USA.
                        My primary interests are renewable energy production, smart grids, and energy equity.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I started my college career at Bellevue College (BC) in 2018.
                        I transferred to the University of Washington Tacoma (UWT) in 2020,
                        where I earned my Bachelor of Science in Electric Engineering in 2023.
                        For my Senior Project at UWT, I developed <a href="self-healing-microgrid.html">a self-healing algorithm for a solar-powered microgrid</a>.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        During my tenure at UWT, I worked on-campus as a Quanititative Tutor for two years.
                        As a tutor, I helped UWT students with math, physics, computer science, and statistics.
                        Working with UWT's diverse student body helped me to communicate with people from different backgrounds and knowledge levels.
                        Being a tutor also fed my interest in making quality education available and accessible to everyone.
                        I hope to be more involved in STEM education at all levels during my career.

                        UWT is where I first became involved the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE).
                        During my junior year, I was inducted into
                        <a href="https://hkn.ieee.org/about">Eta Kappa Nu (IEEE-HKN)</a>,
                        IEEE's honor society.
                        During my senior year, I was a General Officer in my school's IEEE Student Branch.
                        That year, our club designed a battle robot for the 
                        <a href="https://robobrawl.illinois.edu/">annual RoboBrawl competition</a>, 
                        in which I served as leader of the communications team.
                        Upon graduation, I joined the 
                        <a href="https://ieee-pes.org/about-pes/">IEEE Power and Energy Society (IEEE-PES)</a>.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I started working at WSP USA as an Electrical Engineering Intern during my senior year of university.
                        As an intern, I worked on electrification studies for airports seeking to accomodate electric aircraft.
                        After graduation, I joined WSP USA full-time as an Assistant Consultant, Electrical Engineer in the Power & Energy Group.

                        <br>
                        In my free time, I love to cook, read, and exercise.
                        I'm an avid sports fan; my favorite teams are FC Barcelona and the Atlanta Hawks.
                        I've also been learning Spanish for a few years, and I just started learning Japanese.
